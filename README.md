# Employee-Hierarchy-Inheritance-
This project extends an employee hierarchy in C++ by adding CommissionEmployee and Administrator classes. CommissionEmployee calculates pay from sales and commission, while Administrator includes salary and bonus. Both were integrated into simple_test.cpp for testing, ensuring correct payroll calculations and formatted output.
